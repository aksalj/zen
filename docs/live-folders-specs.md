# Zen Live Folders - Specification

## Overview

Live Folders are dynamic, auto-updating folders in Zen.  
Unlike static folders, they fetch and refresh their contents automatically from external sources (e.g., RSS feeds, APIs).  
By default, Live Folders refresh every **30 minutes**, but this interval can be configured in preferences.

---

## Architecture

### `LiveFolderProvider`

- **Abstract base class** for all live folder implementations.
- Defines the contract for fetching and updating live folder contents.
- Responsibilities:
  - Define how to fetch items (abstract method `fetchItems()`).
  - Handle update intervals (default: 30 min).
  - Manage serialization/deserialization of folder state (cache, last update time).
  - Provide metadata (icon, label, description).

```ts
interface FolderItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  url: string;
}

interface FolderMetadata {
  icon: string;
  label: string;
}

interface LiveFolderProvider {
  fetchItems(): Promise<FolderItem[]>;
  getMetadata(): FolderMetadata;
}
```

### Implementations

#### `RssLiveFolderProvider`

- **Description**: Updates live folder contents from an RSS/Atom feed.
- **Configuration**:
  - `url`: URL of the RSS feed.

#### `GithubLiveFolderProvider`

- **Description**: Updates live folder contents from GitHub user's Pull Requests.
- **Configuration**:
  - `username`: GitHub username.

#### `RestAPILiveFolderProvider`

- **Description**: Updates live folder contents from a REST API endpoint.
- **Configuration**:
  - `schema`: JSON schema to validate API responses.

#### Possible future implementations

- `WebhookLiveFolderProvider`

# REST API Live Folder Schema

## Overview

REST-based Live Folders allow Zen to fetch JSON data from an HTTP(S) endpoint and map it into folder items.  
Each REST Live Folder must provide a **schema-compliant response** that Zen can parse into items.

- **Remote APIs (https://, http://)**: Flexible schema (mapping via config).
- **Localhost APIs (http://127.0.0.1, http://localhost)**: Must strictly follow Zenâ€™s **Local REST Schema** for security and consistency.

---

## Common Rules

- Requests are always `GET`.
- Responses **must be JSON**.
- CORS headers are ignored (Zen fetches internally).
- Max response size: **1 MB** (to prevent abuse).
- Items exceeding `liveFolder.maxItems` (default 100) will be trimmed.

---

## Remote REST Schema

Remote APIs can return any JSON, but the Live Folder must provide a mapping configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "rest",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/posts",
  "mapping": {
    "items": "data.posts",
    "id": "id",
    "title": "headline",
    "url": "link"
  }
}
```

### Installation of REST API Live Folder

These schemas would be stored inside a marketplace on Zen's web platform, allowing users to easily discover and integrate new REST API Live Folders into their workspace.

If the user wants to create a new REST API Live Folder, they can do so by providing the necessary schema and configuration through the marketplace interface. This will enable them to customize the folder's behavior and data mapping according to their specific needs.

If it's a custom API and the schema is not publicly available, users can still create a Live Folder by defining their own mapping configuration. This allows them to integrate with proprietary APIs while adhering to Zen's Live Folder standards. This mapping configuration will be fetched via `https://example.com/zen-live-folder.schema.json`.
